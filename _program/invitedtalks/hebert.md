**Biography:** Martial Hebert is a Professor of Robotics at Carnegie Mellon
University and Director of the Robotics Institute, which he joined in 1984. His
interests include computer vision, in particular recognition in images and video
data, model building and object recognition from 3D data, and perception for
mobile robots and for intelligent vehicles. His group has developed approaches
for object recognition and scene analysis in images, 3D point clouds, and video
sequences. In the area of machine perception for robotics, his group has
developed techniques for people detection, tracking, and prediction, and for
understanding the environment of ground vehicles from sensor data. He has served
on the editorial boards of the IEEE Transactions on Robotics and Automation, the
IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, and the
International Journal of Computer Vision (for which he currently serves as
Editor-in-Chief).
