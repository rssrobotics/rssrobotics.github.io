  <b>Title:</b>
  Machine Learning in the Closed Loop:  Safety and Performance Guarantees for Robot Learning
  <br><br>

  <b>Abstract:</b>

  The ultimate promise of robotics is to design devices that can
  physically interact with the world. To date, robots have been
  primarily deployed in highly structured and predictable
  environments. However, we envision the next generation of robots
  (ranging from self-driving and -flying vehicles to robot assistants)
  to operate in unpredictable and generally unknown environments
  alongside humans. This challenges current robot algorithms, which
  have been largely based on a-priori knowledge about the system and
  its environment. While research has shown that robots are able to
  learn new skills from experience and adapt to unknown situations,
  these results have been mostly limited to learning single tasks, and
  demonstrated in simulation or lab settings. The next challenge is to
  enable robot learning in real-world application scenarios. This will
  require versatile, data-efficient and online learning algorithms
  that guarantee safety when placed in a closed-loop system
  architecture. It will also require to answer the fundamental
  question of how to design learning architectures for dynamic and
  interactive agents. This talk will highlight our recent progress in
  combining learning methods with formal results from control
  theory. By combining models with data, our algorithms achieve
  adaptation to changing conditions during long-term operation,
  data-efficient multi-robot, multi-task transfer learning, and safe
  reinforcement learning. We demonstrate our algorithms in
  vision-based off-road driving and drone flight experiments, as well
  as on mobile manipulators.

  <b>Biography:</b>

  Angela Schoellig is an Assistant Professor at the University of
  Toronto Institute for Aerospace Studies and an Associate Director of
  the Centre for Aerial Robotics Research and Education. She holds a
  Canada Research Chair in Machine Learning for Robotics and Control,
  is a principal investigator of the NSERC Canadian Robotics Network,
  and is a Faculty Affiliate of the Vector Institute for Artificial
  Intelligence. She conducts research at the intersection of robotics,
  controls, and machine learning. Her goal is to enhance the
  performance, safety, and autonomy of robots by enabling them to
  learn from past experiments and from each other. She is a recipient
  of a Sloan Research Fellowship (2017), an Ontario Early Researcher
  Award (2017), and a Connaught New Researcher Award (2015). She is
  one of MIT Technology Review’s Innovators Under 35 (2017), a Canada
  Science Leadership Program Fellow (2014), and one of Robohub’s “25
  women in robotics you need to know about (2013)”. Her team won the
  2018 North-American SAE AutoDrive Challenge sponsored by General
  Motors. Her PhD at ETH Zurich (2013) was awarded the ETH Medal and
  the Dimitris N. Chorafas Foundation Award. She holds both an
  M.Sc. in Engineering Cybernetics from the University of Stuttgart
  (2008) and an M.Sc. in Engineering Science and Mechanics from the
  Georgia Institute of Technology (2007). More information can be

  <b>Title:</b>
  On safe and efficient human-robot interactions via multimodal intent modeling and reachability-based safety assurance
  <br><br>

  <b>Abstract:</b>

  In this talk I will present a decision-making and control stack for
  human-robot interactions by using autonomous driving as a motivating
  example. Specifically, I will first discuss a data-driven approach
  for learning multimodal interaction dynamics between robot-driven
  and human-driven vehicles based on recent advances in deep
  generative modeling. Then, I will discuss how to incorporate such a
  learned interaction model into a real-time, interaction-aware
  decision-making framework. The framework is designed to be minimally
  interventional; in particular, by leveraging backward reachability
  analysis, it ensures safety even when other cars defy the robot's
  expectations without unduly sacrificing performance. I will present
  recent results from experiments on a full-scale steer-by-wire
  platform, validating the framework and providing practical
  insights. I will conclude the talk by providing an overview of
  related efforts from my group on infusing safety assurances in robot
  autonomy stacks equipped with learning-based components, with an
  emphasis on adding structure within robot learning via
  control-theoretical and formal methods.
