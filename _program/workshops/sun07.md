<p>
Resilient intelligent systems introspect, adapt, and evolve to changing robot and
environment models and application objectives. A fundamental challenge to achieving resilient
operation is the development of robust techniques that enable online learning and adaptation
while preserving the performance guarantees required to ensure safe and stable autonomy.
</p>

<p>
The goal of this workshop is to discuss the fundamental challenges to achieving resilience in
intelligent robots given online learning and adaptation within the feedback loop. The workshop
brings together expertise in the areas of learning, planning, perception, and control to discuss
the implications of recent advancements in online learning and experiential techniques to
broader robotics areas that leverage learned models but require additional performance
guarantees to ensure safe operation. Researchers from academia and industry working in
topical areas such as active perception, human-robot interaction, manipulation, and multi-robot
coordination will discuss the fundamental challenges that arise in pursuit of resilient intelligence
and robust autonomy.
</p>

<p>
The workshop will consist of topical presentations and a panel discussion by a cross-disciplinary
group of experts with the goal of highlighting the common challenges that arise due to online
learning and adaptation (at the levels of planning, perception, and control) within the autonomy
feedback loop and the performance implications. A poster session will highlight recent research
advancements.
