title: "Challenges in Dynamic Legged Locomotion"

<p><i>Organizers: Diego Pardo, Michael Posa, Scott Kuindersma</i></p>

<p>
The performance of modern legged robots still pales in comparison to their
biological counterparts in terms of speed, robustness, versatility, and
efficiency. The technical challenges that fuel this gap touch on topics ranging
from actuator design to contact modeling and hybrid optimal control. This
workshop aims to bring together researchers working on a span of topics at the
frontier of legged robotics research relating to design, modeling, estimation,
and control.
</p>

<p> 
The dynamic properties of legged locomotion (i.e. nonlinear, underactuated,
and hybrid) pose significant theoretical, computational, and physical
challenges. Traditional approaches to tackling this dynamic complexity have
used a combination of model simplification and factoring of planning,
estimation, and control into a sequence of computationally-expedient
sub-problems. By ignoring aspects of the robot dynamics and/or removing the
ability to reason about feedback during planning, these simplifications degrade
performance.  However, we still lack a detailed understanding as to what
dynamic complexity/computation trade-off is necessary to achieve a given
behavior specification, and how these choices are affected by robot design.

<p>
The workshop will be framed by the following questions and technical topics:
<ul>
● What is the impact of model simplifications and assumptions on the efficiency, robustness and
performance of the solutions?
<li>What are the key physical limitations of modern legged robots?
<li>Should we be designing control systems and hardware together?
<li>Are we overlooking the complexity of the contact model or are current approximations sufficient?
<li>Topics:
<ul>
<li>Trajectory optimization for legged locomotion
<li>Modeling frictional contact for planning, feedback control, and estimation
<li>Planning in reduced spaces (e.g., centroidal dynamics, SLIP)
<li>Feedback motion planning; optimizing robustness
<li>Model-predictive control (e.g., DDP variants)
<li>Verification/analysis of motions involving rigid contact
<li>Actuator and mechanism design for legged robots
<li>Whole-body state estimation
</ul>
</ul>
