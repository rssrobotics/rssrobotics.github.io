<p>
The timeliness of this workshop is granted by our aspirations to solve
increasingly complex problems that require a distribution of distinct
capabilities among robot team members. During the process of developing such
solutions, heterogeneity and diversity become design features. However, we
still lack the necessary analytical tools that help us understand the
implications. By building on foundational concepts of network science,
security, and robustness, we should aim at developing formal definitions of
resilience that can be applied to networked multi-robot systems. The workshop's
scope of topics will explore the various dimensions along which heterogeneity
and diversity occur: behavioral, functional, morphological, temporal, and
spatial.
