    Frank Park received his B.S. in EECS from MIT in 1985, and Ph.D. in applied
    mathematics from Harvard University in 1991. He joined the mechanical and
    aerospace engineering faculty at the University of California, Irvine in
    1991, and since 1995 he has been professor of mechanical and aerospace
    engineering at Seoul National University, where he is currently serving as
    department chair since June 2017. His research interests are in robot
    mechanics, planning and control, vision and image processing, machine
    learning, and related areas of applied mathematics. He has been an IEEE
    Robotics and Automation Society Distinguished Lecturer, and received best
    paper awards for his work on visual tracking and parallel robot design. He
    has served on the editorial boards of the Springer Handbook of Robotics,
    Springer Advanced Tracts in Robotics (STAR), Robotica, and the ASME Journal
    of Mechanisms and Robotics. He has held adjunct faculty positions at the NYU
    Courant Institute and the Interactive Computing Department at Georgia Tech,
    and is currently adjunct professor at the Robotics Institute at HKUST. He is
    a fellow of the IEEE, current editor-in-chief of the IEEE Transactions on
    Robotics, developer of the EDX course Robot Mechanics and Control I, II, and
    co-author (with Kevin Lynch) of Modern Robotics: Mechanics, Planning and
    Control (2017 Cambridge University Press).

    Dieter Fox is a Professor in the Paul G. Allen School of Computer
    Science & Engineering at the University of Washington, where he heads the UW
    Robotics and State Estimation Lab. From 2009 to 2011, he was also Director of
    the Intel Research Labs Seattle. Dieter obtained his Ph.D. from the University
    of Bonn, Germany.  His research is in robotics and artificial intelligence with
    a focus on state estimation and perception applied to various problems in
    robotics and activity recognition. He has published more than 170 technical
    papers and is the co-author of the textbook “Probabilistic Robotics.” He is a
    Fellow of the IEEE and the AAAI, and he received several best paper awards at
    major robotics, AI, and computer vision conferences. He was an editor of the
    IEEE Transactions on Robotics, program co-chair of the 2008 AAAI Conference on
    Artificial Intelligence, and program chair of the 2013 Robotics: Science and
    Systems conference.

    Martial Hebert is a Professor of Robotics at Carnegie Mellon University and
    Director of the Robotics Institute, which he joined in 1984. His interests
    include computer vision, in particular recognition in images and video
    data, model building and object recognition from 3D data, and perception for
    mobile robots and for intelligent vehicles. His group has developed
    approaches for object recognition and scene analysis in images, 3D point
    clouds, and video sequences. In the area of machine perception for robotics,
    his group has developed techniques for people detection, tracking, and
    prediction, and for understanding the environment of ground vehicles from
    sensor data. He has served on the editorial boards of the IEEE Transactions on
    Robotics and Automation, the IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and
    Machine Intelligence, and the International Journal of Computer Vision (for
    which he currently serves as Editor-in-Chief).
