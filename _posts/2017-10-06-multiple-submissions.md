title: Multiple Submissions
---

Submissions that are identical (or substantially similar) to versions that have
been previously published, or accepted for publication, or that have been
submitted in parallel to other conferences are not appropriate for RSS and
violate our dual submission policy.

Exceptions to this rule are the following:

1. Submission is permitted of a short version of a paper that has been submitted
to a journal, but has not yet been published in that journal. Authors must
declare such dual-submissions either through the paper upload submission form,
or via email to the program chair. It is the authorsâ€™ responsibility to make
sure that the journal in question allows dual concurrent submissions to
conferences.
2. Submission is permitted for papers presented or to be presented at
conferences or workshops without proceedings, or with only abstracts published.
3. It is acceptable to submit to RSS work that has been made available as a
technical report (or similar, e.g. in arXiv) without citing it.

None of the above should be construed as overriding the requirements of other
publishing venues. In addition, keep in mind that author anonymity to RSS
reviewers might be compromised for authors availing themselves of exceptions 2
and 3.
