All papers in this year's RSS will be presented as a short talk and poster. To
find the time of your talk, please see
the [program]({{ site.baseurl }}/program/detailed/). The format of
presentations is the same as last year. Video recordings from RSS 2014
presented in this format are available
[here](http://rll.berkeley.edu/RSS2014/videos.html) for your reference.

If you have questions after reading the instructions below, please contact Ani
Majumdar or Tucker Hermans (Presentation Co-Chairs) for issues regarding short
talks or posters.

## Short Talks

Short talks run a maximum of 5 minutes, aided by a pre-prepared video.

Each short talk session will consist of up to 4 paper presentations. First, the
5-minute presentations paper presentations with associated video slides will be
presented; no questions will be taken during this time. Next, there will be a
common 10-minute question period for all papers presented in that
session. Presenters should be seated on the right side of the auditorium when
facing the stage in the front row at least 5 minutes before the session
starts. Conference personnel will be there to help you get the lapel microphone
on before your talk. All presenters will return to the stage for the common
question and answer session after the last presentation in the session.

### 5-Minute Video for Short Talks

You will have a 5-minute slot to give an overview of your paper. You must
provide, in advance, a 300 second MP4 video which will play on the conference
laptop during your short talk. You cannot use your own laptop and will have no
control over the playback of this video. The session chair will hit "start", and
you will be coaxed off the stage 5 minutes later!

Please submit your video [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/submit). The submission
website will open on July 1, 2017 and **close on July 10th, 2017, 18:00
([anywhere on Earth](https://time.is/Anywhere_on_Earth))**. This is a strict deadline, and there will be no extension or
exception, as we need time to verify video compatibility, resolve any potential
problems, and download to the conference laptop. If you have not uploaded the
video by the deadline, you will still have your 5-minute slot, but you will not
have access to slides or any other materials that require a projector.

You can prepare your 300 second MP4 file in any manner you want. For example,
you can generate a conventional Powerpoint or Keynote talk and export (if your
software supports it) directly to MP4. Or you can use video-editing
software. Target 1440x1080 at 30fps. We do not recommend relying on audio, since
there will be no opportunity to check volume levels.

For convenience, we have developed a website that will convert a PDF file to an
MP4 for you (available from June 22, 2017). This is intended to make it easy for
users to generate a compliant MP4 file with little additional effort. The basic
process is:

* Use Keynote/Powerpoint/Beamer to generate your slides as usual.
* Export your slides to PDF.
* Upload your PDF
  to [http://roboticsconference.org/pdf2mp4]({{ site.baseurl }}/pdf2mp4)
  (website becomes available June 22, 2017).
* Adjust the timing of each slide such that total time is 300 seconds.
* Click "Preview" to quickly generate a low-resolution, low frame-rate version
  of your talk. This is suitable for practicing your talk (note: won't play in
  VLC due to a bug in VLC's handling of low-frame-rate videos).
* Click "Final" to render a high-resolution version suitable for submitting
  to [http://roboticsconference.org/submit]({{ site.baseurl }}/submit). Note
  that this can take a half hour or more.
* Note that the PDF2MP4 website will overlay "progress bars" on each slide,
  allowing you to anticipate when the next slide will appear. You can also
  insert short videos into your talk, but note that any audio data is
  discarded. The RSS organizers believe that the functionality offered by this
  site is more than adequate for producing a great talk for RSS. It is
  recommended that authors try the site early to understand its capabilities and
  decide whether they will use the site or resort to their own video editing.
* If you do not use the PDF2MP4 website, consider adding some sort of visual cue
  that will help you anticipate when the next slide will change, e.g., a red dot
  that appears five seconds before the next slide. (The PDF2MP4 site that is
  provided will add a progress bar to the bottom of each slide automatically).

If you have a video that you'd like to use that is not in MP4 format, we
recommend using the free software Handbrake to convert it. The "AppleTV3" preset
should work well.

## Poster Instructions

In addition to the 5 minute talks all accepted papers will be presenting posters
at evening poster sessions.

### Poster Size

You will have a total area of 48 in. by 48 in. to mount your poster. We
recommend printing posters to be 36 in. wide by 48 in. tall or using A0 if
metric is easier for you to print.

### Recommended Font Sizes

We recommend not using fonts smaller than 24pt on the posters. We recommend
titles to be at least size 72pt up to 96pt.  We have provided example posters
for two RSS 2017 papers one prepared in
the [portrait format]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/Bala_RSS2017_Poster.pdf) (36
in. wide by 48 in. tall) and one
in [landscape]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/Dorsa_RSS2017_Poster.pdf) (48 in. wide by
36 in. tall) to aid in preparing your poster.

### Poster Sessions

Poster sessions will run from 6:00-9:00PM on Wednesday and Thursday evening.

* Papers with spotlight talks on Wednesday: posters will be presented at the
  poster session on Wednesday (6:00-9:00 PM)
* Papers with spotlight talks on Thursday: posters will be presented at the
  poster session on Thursday (6:00-9:00 PM)
* Papers with spotlight talks in Groups 15, 16, 17 on Friday: posters will be
  presented on Wednesday (6:00-9:00 PM)
* Papers with spotlight talks in Groups 18, 19, 20 on Friday: posters will be
  presented on Thursday (6:00-9:00 PM)

### Multimedia extras

Space constraints at the poster session restrict us from providing tables to sit
laptops on to play videos associated with the work. If you feel videos are
necessary to help your poster presentation we recommend bringing your own
hand-held device to display them, such as a tablet or phone.

## Additional Suggestions

The RSS Foundation posted a letter to the RSS community in November of 2013. One
part of this letter contained helpful tips for short talks:

* Avoid high-density slides. The point of slides is not to remind you, the
  speaker, of what you wanted to say. Slides are a visual aid for you to
  facilitate making an argument. A simple heuristic: only put on your slides
  what you would write or draw on a board if you were giving the talk without
  slides.
* Practice. Almost everyone will benefit from multiple practice sessions (some
  of which ideally with an audience). Your goal in practicing is to be
  comfortable with what you plan to say on every slide without attempting to
  memorize a rigid script.
* When time is up, stop. No one wants to cut you off in mid-sentence, but the
  schedule does not allow for "grace periods". Be done when the timer hits zero,
  and remember that no one will be upset if your talk ends 30 seconds early.
* Let your enthusiasm come through. Help everyone understand why you are excited
  about your work.

Adding to the above, it is critical to remember that RSS is comprised of
researchers from widely different fields. Your talk should make sense to the
full audience, not only the subset in your specialized area.
