All papers in this year’s RSS will be presented as a short talk and
poster. To find the time of your talk, please see the program. The
format of presentations is the same as the previous years. For
example, video recordings from RSS 2014 presented in this format are
available [here](http://rll.berkeley.edu/RSS2014/videos.html) for your reference.

If you have questions after reading the instructions below, please
contact [Henrich Kolkhorst](mailto:kolkhorst@informatik.uni-freiburg.de) (Presentation Chair) for issues
regarding short talks or posters.

## Short Talks

Short talks run a maximum of 4 minutes, aided by a pre-prepared video.

Each session will consist of 5 paper presentations. First, the
4-minute presentations will be presented in sequence; no questions
will be taken during this time. Next, there will be a common 10-minute
question period for all papers presented in that session. Presenters
should introduce themselves to the session chair at least 10 minutes
before the session starts. Conference personnel will be there to
help. All presenters will return to the stage for the common question
and answer session after the last presentation in the session.

### 4-Minute Video for Short Talks

You will have a 4-minute slot to give an overview of your paper. You
must provide, in advance, a 240 second MP4 video which will play on
the conference laptop during your short talk. You cannot use your own
laptop and you will have no control over the playback of this
video. The session chair will hit “start”, and you will be coaxed off
the stage 4 minutes later!

The submission website for the videos is now available. You should
have received an email containing the adress (if not, please contact
[Henrich Kolkhorst](mailto:kolkhorst@informatik.uni-freiburg.de)
directly). The website will close on June 14, 2018, (anywhere on
Earth). This is a strict deadline, and there will be no extension or
exception, as we need time to verify video compatibility, resolve any
potential problems, and download to the conference laptop. If you have
not uploaded the video by the deadline, you will still have your
4-minute slot, but you will not have access to slides or any other
materials that require a projector.

You can prepare your 240 second MP4 file in any manner you want. For
example, you can generate a conventional Powerpoint or Keynote talk
and export (if your software supports it) directly to MP4, or you can
use video-editing software. Target 1920x1080 or 1440x1080 at 30fps. We
do not recommend relying on audio, since there will be no opportunity
to check volume levels.

For convenience, we also provide a website that will convert a PDF
file to an MP4 for you
<a href="http://pdf2mp4.informatik.uni-freiburg.de">http://pdf2mp4.informatik.uni-freiburg.de</a>. The
same tool is also available as an online service from a third party on
[http://pdf2mp4.com/](http://pdf2mp4.com/).

We are pleased to announce that everyone who cannot make it to
Freiburg for RSS 2019 will be able to watch all oral presentations per
livestream via the RSS youtube channel. For this purpose, your talk
will be recorded and transmitted with live video, sound, and
synchronized presentation slides on <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCeEbAUGjtBlzmqWO5u6VeGg/live">this
livestream</a>. After RSS 2019, the presentations will be available as
on-demand videos on the RSS youtube channel. During the file upload
for the presentation video, you will be asked to agree to streaming
your presentation.

<!--
For convenience, we have developed a website that will convert a PDF
file to an MP4 for you (available from May 27, 2018). This is intended
to make it easy for users to generate a compliant MP4 file with little
additional effort. The basic process is:

 - Use Keynote/Powerpoint/Beamer to generate your slides as usual.
 - Export your slides to PDF.
 - Upload your PDF to
   [http://roboticsconference.org/pdf2mp4]({{ site.baseurl }}/pdf2mp4)
   (website becomes available May 27, 2018).
 - Adjust the timing of each slide such that total time is 300 seconds.
 - Click “Preview” to quickly generate a low-resolution, low frame-rate version
   of your talk. This is suitable for practicing your talk (note: the video
   won’t play in VLC due to a bug in VLC’s handling of low-frame-rate videos).
 - Click “Final” to render a high-resolution version suitable for submitting to
   [http://roboticsconference.org/submit]({{ site.baseurl }}/submit).
   Note that this can take a half hour or more.
 - Note that the PDF2MP4 website will overlay “progress bars” on each slide,
   allowing you to anticipate when the next slide will appear. You can also
   insert short videos into your talk, but note that any audio data is
   discarded. The RSS organizers believe that the functionality offered by this
   site is more than adequate for producing a great talk for RSS. It is
   recommended that authors try the site early to understand its capabilities
   and decide whether they will use the site or resort to their own video
   editing.
 - If you do not use the PDF2MP4 website, consider adding some sort of visual
   cue that will help you anticipate when the next slide will change, e.g., a
   red dot that appears five seconds before the next slide. (The PDF2MP4 site
   that is provided will add a progress bar to the bottom of each slide
   automatically).
 - If you have a video that you’d like to use that is not in MP4 format, we
   recommend using the free software Handbrake to convert it. The “AppleTV3”
   preset should work well.

All papers in this year’s RSS will be presented as a short talk and poster. To
find the time of your talk, please see the [program](http://www.roboticsconference.org/program/detailed/). The format of presentations
is the same as the previous years. For example, video recordings from RSS 2014
presented in this format are available
[here](http://rll.berkeley.edu/RSS2014/videos.html) for your reference.

If you have questions after reading the instructions below, please contact Chris
Amato or Amanda Prorok (Presentation Co-Chairs) for issues regarding short talks
or posters.

## Short Talks

Short talks run a maximum of 5 minutes, aided by a pre-prepared video.

Each session will consist of 4-5 paper presentations. First, the 5-minute
presentations will be presented in sequence; no questions will be taken during
this time. Next, there will be a common 5-10-minute question period for all
papers presented in that session. Presenters should be seated on the right side
of the auditorium when facing the stage in the front row at least 10 minutes
before the session starts. Conference personnel will be there to help you get
the lapel microphone on before your talk. All presenters will return to the
stage for the common question and answer session after the last presentation in
the session.

### 5-Minute Video for Short Talks

You will have a 5-minute slot to give an overview of your paper. You must
provide, in advance, a 300 second MP4 video which will play on the conference
laptop during your short talk. You cannot use your own laptop and you will have
no control over the playback of this video. The session chair will hit “start”,
and you will be coaxed off the stage 5 minutes later!

Please submit your video
[here]({{ site.baseurl }}/submit). The submission
website will open on June 1, 2018 and **close on June 18th, 2018, ([anywhere
on Earth](https://time.is/Anywhere_on_Earth))**. This is a strict deadline, and
there will be no extension or exception, as we need time to verify video
compatibility, resolve any potential problems, and download to the conference
laptop. If you have not uploaded the video by the deadline, you will still have
your 5-minute slot, but you will not have access to slides or any other
materials that require a projector.

You can prepare your 300 second MP4 file in any manner you want. For example,
you can generate a conventional Powerpoint or Keynote talk and export (if your
software supports it) directly to MP4. Or you can use video-editing software.
Target 1920x1080 or 1440x1080 at 30fps. We do not recommend relying on audio,

## Poster Instructions
In addition to the 4 minute talks all accepted papers will be
presenting posters at afternoon poster sessions. Please mount your
posters in the morning between 8:30 and 9:00 on the day your talk is scheduled.

### Poster Format
You will have a total area of 150x120cm portrait
format to mount your poster. We recommend printing posters in A0. We
recommend not using fonts smaller than 24pt on the posters, and titles
to be at least size 72pt up to 96pt.

### Poster Sessions
Poster sessions will run from 3:30pm-5:00pm on Monday and Wednesday,
and 4:00pm-5:30pm on Tuesday. Posters will be presented on the same
day as their corresponding spotlight talks. Posters of the Best Paper
Nominees will be presented in Monday's poster session.

### Multimedia extras
Space constraints at the poster session restrict
us from providing tables to sit laptops on to play videos associated
with the work. If you feel videos are necessary to help your poster
presentation we recommend bringing your own hand-held device to
display them, such as a tablet or phone.

## Additional Suggestions
The RSS Foundation posted a letter to the
RSS community in November of 2013. One part of this letter contained
helpful tips for short talks:

- Avoid high-density slides. The point of the slides is not to remind
  you, the speaker, of what you wanted to say. Slides are a visual aid
  for you to facilitate making an argument. A simple heuristic: only
  put on your slides what you would write or draw on a board if you
  were giving the talk without slides.

- Practice. Almost everyone will benefit from multiple practice
  sessions (some of which ideally with an audience). Your goal in
  practicing is to be comfortable with what you plan to say on every
  slide without attempting to memorize a rigid script.

- When time is up, stop. No one wants to cut you off in mid-sentence,
  but the schedule does not allow for “grace periods”. Be done when
  the timer hits zero, and remember that no one will be upset if your
  talk ends 30 seconds early.

- Let your enthusiasm come through. Help everyone understand why you
  are excited about your work.

Adding to the above, it is critical to remember that RSS is comprised
of researchers from widely different fields. Your talk should make
sense to the full audience, not only the subset in your specialized
area.

## Poster Instructions
In addition to the 5 minute talks all accepted papers will be presenting posters
at afternoon poster sessions.

### Poster Format
You will have a total area of 48 in. by 48 in. to mount your poster. We
recommend printing posters to be 36 in. wide by 48 in. tall or using A0 if
metric is easier for you to print. We recommend not using fonts smaller than
24pt on the posters, and titles to be at least size 72pt up to 96pt.

### Poster Sessions
Poster sessions will run from 4:30-6:00pm on Tuesday and Wednesday, and
3:00pm-4:15pm on Thursday. Posters will be presented on the same day as their
corresponding spotlight talks.

### Multimedia extras
Space constraints at the poster session restrict us from providing tables to sit
laptops on to play videos associated with the work. If you feel videos are
necessary to help your poster presentation we recommend bringing your own
hand-held device to display them, such as a tablet or phone.
