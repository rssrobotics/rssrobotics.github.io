The 2019 Robotics: Science and Systems Conference will bring together researchers working on all aspects of robotics including scientific foundations, applications, and analysis of robotic systems. We seek your best work in all 
areas of robotics and solicit papers that cover both the “Science” and the “Systems” of robotics. 

The conference will be single-track, and the final program will be the result of a thorough review process to give attendees an opportunity to see the most exciting research in all areas of robotics. Submissions will be evaluated 
in terms of their novelty, technical quality, significance, potential impact, and clarity.

The program will include invited talks as well as oral and poster presentations of accepted papers. The three-day main session will be preceded by two days of workshops and tutorials. Every effort is being made to keep the 
conference affordable, particularly for student attendees.

For the first time with RSS, authors will have two options to submit to RSS'19: directly through the RSS submission portal (RSS-Direct), or using the RSS option that is offered by IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters (RAL/RSS).  
Important details of how RSS’19 submission and review will work in the two cases are reported in the Author Information page.

The RAL/RSS option will complement, and not replace, the tradition of RSS special issues in other journals.  Selected papers from the RSS-Direct stream will be invited for submission to special issues of other prestigious 
Robotics journals, as usual.

*Important Dates*

*    Full Paper Submission Deadline (RA-L/RSS): January 20, 2019 (23.59 PT)
*    Full Paper Submission Deadline (RSS only): February 1, 2019 (23.59 PT)
*    Workshop Proposal Submission Deadline: March 1, 2018
*    Acceptance Notification: May 1, 2019

*Themes*

RSS is actively seeking papers in areas that have not been traditionally represented at the conference and will stay true to its name covering both the "Science" and the "Systems" of robotics. Papers containing
original and unpublished work are solicited in all areas of robotics, including (but not limited to) the following themes:

* **Robot AI and Learning** (SPECIAL INTEREST TOPIC)
* **Soft and Bio-Inspired Robotics** (SPECIAL INTEREST TOPIC)

* **Applications**
* **Cognitive Robotics**
* **Field Robotics**
* **Human-Centered Robotics and Automation**
* **Humanoids and Animaloids**
* **Localization and Mapping**
* **Manipulation and Grasping**
* **Manufacturing, Process, and Service Automation**
* **Mechanisms, Design, and Control**
* **Medical and Rehabilitation**
* **Micro, Nano, and Biomimetic Systems**
* **Multiple and Distributed Systems**
* **Planning and Simulation**
* **Theoretical Foundations**
* **Vision and Sensor-Based Control**
* **Visual Perception and Learning**

*Author Information*

Submissions will be evaluated in terms of their technical quality, novelty, significance, potential impact, and clarity.  All papers accepted for presentation at the 
main conference will be published in the online proceedings.  Please visit the [author instructions]({{ site.baseurl }}/information/authorinfo) page for further details.
