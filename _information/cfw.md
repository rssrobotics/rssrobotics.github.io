The Organizing Committee for the 2017 Robotics: Science and Systems Conference (RSS 2017) requests proposals for full and half-day workshops, tutorials and demonstrations to be held on July 15–16, 2017 at MIT, Cambridge, MA, CA, USA.

The RSS workshops have consistently provided high-quality, topically-focused forums for researchers at the forefront of robotics. This year these events will take place during a weekend after the main conference.

Workshops are intended to supplement the primary conference; as such we seek workshops that will provide a complement to the large single-track event.

Specifically, we welcome and will give priority to:

1. Innovative ideas on structuring the events in a way that will promote discussion and interaction among the participants.
2. Proposals with high-quality and diverse speakers, and which lay out plans for encouraging speakers to focus their talks on the workshop topic (as opposed to delivering generic talks).
3. Proposals from communities that have not traditionally participated at RSS but are relevant to robotics science, robotics systems, and the practice and philosophy of the discipline and our community more broadly.
4. Workshops that will encourage analysis and reflection on topics and issues that formulate challenge problems and that promote discussion, debates, and long-term visions for the discipline.

Also, we note that the two special themes for RSS 2017: (1) Kinematics, Dynamics, and Control, and (2) Mechanisms, will also be promoted in the selection of workshops, provided they fulfill the guidelines above.

In addition to traditional workshops, this year’s workshop submission process will feature a special “outlier” track that pushes the boundaries of academic workshops by examining ideas that are (i) important for the field; (ii) hard done by the formal peer-review process. Building on the successes of RSS 2016 (one workshop involved aspects of dance, another a custom card game), the track will explore unconventional formats and topics that eschew current orthodoxy.


## Submissions
We expect proposals to be approximately 2–3 pages in length, and no more than 5 pages.
