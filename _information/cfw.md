The Organizing Committee for the 2019 Robotics: Science and Systems Conference (RSS 2019) requests proposals for full and half-day workshops and tutorials to be held on June 22-26, 2019 at Freiburg, Germany.

The RSS workshops have consistently provided high-quality, topically-focused forums for researchers at the forefront of robotics. This year these events will take place on Saturday and Sunday before the main conference.

Workshops are intended to supplement the primary conference; as such we seek workshops that will provide a complement to the large single-track event.

Specifically, we welcome and will give priority to:

* Fully elaborated proposals with lists of confirmed, high-quality, diverse invited speakers as well as selected poster or presentation speakers. The workshop proposers should encourage exclusive commitment of the invited speakers 
and the proposals should lay out plans for encouraging invited speakers to focus their talks on the workshop topic (as opposed to delivering generic talks). Practical demonstrations may also be part of a workshop to show exciting 
research results. 
* Innovative ideas on structuring the events in a way that will promote discussion and interaction among the participants. 
* Proposals from communities that have not traditionally participated at RSS but are 
relevant to robotics science, robotics systems, and the practice and philosophy of the discipline and our community more broadly. 
* Workshops that will encourage analysis and reflection on topics and issues that formulate 
challenge problems and that promote discussion, debates, and long-term visions for the discipline.

Also, we note that the two special themes for RSS 2019: (1) **Robot AI and Learning**, and (2) **Soft and Bio-Inspired Robotics**, will also be promoted in the selection of workshops, provided they fulfill the guidelines above.

In addition to traditional workshops, there will be a special “outlier” track that pushes the boundaries of academic workshops by examining ideas that are (i) important for the field, and (ii) poorly treated by the formal 
peer-review process. The track will explore unconventional formats and topics that eschew current orthodoxy.

*Submissions*

We expect proposals to be approximately 2–3 pages in length, and no more than 5 pages. Here are the [proposal template]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/RSS19-workshop-template.txt) and [sample review 
form]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/RSS19-workshop-review-form.txt). Submissions are now open on [papercept](https://ras.papercept.net/conferences/scripts/start.pl).

*Important Dates*

*  Workshop Proposal Submission Deadline: March 1, 2019
*  Acceptance Notification: May 1, 2019
*  Dates: June 22-26, 2019 (Main Conference: June 24-26, Workshops: June 22-23), Freiburg, Germany
