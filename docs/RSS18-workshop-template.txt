Workshop Proposal Template

1. Type of Event
[e.g., workshop, tutorial, competition, demonstration]
--------------------------------------------------------------------

2. Title of Proposed Event
--------------------------------------------------------------------

3. Organizers
[Please:
* Provide email addresses, URLs, affiliations, and brief bios.
* Explain why the team is a good fit for organizing this workshop.
* Indicate which one of the organizers will act as the contact
person. (The expectation is that the contact person will be able to
promptly respond to messages from the workshop co-chairs.)] 
--------------------------------------------------------------------

4. URL for event
[This link should be active at the time of the proposal with
preliminary/tentative information. The page should clearly indicate
that it is a "Proposed RSS Event".] 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

5. Duration
[e.g., 1/2 day, 1 day, 2 days]
-------------------------------------------------------------------

6. Abstract
[This should be a short paragraph that will be used to advertise the
workshop through the web page of RSS. Please limit the abstract to 250
words. The abstract will be used to describe the workshop on the RSS
website.] 
--------------------------------------------------------------------

7. List of speakers/participants
[Please provide a list of speakers and potential topics; indicate
whether speakers have been confirmed or that final confirmation is
pending. How will you ensure that speakers do not just give their
generic talk, but actually focus on the topic?] 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

8. Description of the event
[Please provide details regarding the event, such as intended
schedule and structure, e.g., sessions, discussion, panels, debates,
poster sessions. What steps will you take in order to encourage
discussion and interactions during the event? Also describe if you
will be soliciting contributed papers and what the format for
presenting them will be (e.g. poster only, poster plus 1 or 5min
spotlight talk, regular talk).] 
--------------------------------------------------------------------

9. Plan for soliciting participation 
[Describe what steps you will take in order to advertise and encourage
participation in your event. Steps in this direction that go beyond
sending an email to robotics-worldwide are encouraged.] 
--------------------------------------------------------------------

10. Intended audience
[Provide a description of the communities that will be interested in
this event and why you believe they will attend. Indicate whether
communities related to robotics that are not traditionally
participating at RSS would be interested in your event. Mention
related past events, if any, and their level of success.] 
--------------------------------------------------------------------

11. Diversity
[Provide a description of how you are ensuring that the workshop is
diverse in ideas and participation. Describe how the speakers were
chosen and whether they are diverse in gender, race, background, or
seniority.] 
--------------------------------------------------------------------

12. Equipment requirements
[E.g., whether you plan to have posters - how many do you expect to
need? Flip charts - how many? Please list everything that requires
logistics or monetary effort from our side.] 
--------------------------------------------------------------------

13. Outlier Track
[Describe if this proposal should be considered as part of the
outlier track. The outlier track pushes the boundaries of academic
workshops by examining ideas that are (i) important for the field;
(ii) poorly treated by the formal peer-review process. Building on the
successes of RSS 2016 (one workshop involved aspects of dance, another
a custom card game), the track will explore unconventional formats and
topics that eschew current orthodoxy.]
