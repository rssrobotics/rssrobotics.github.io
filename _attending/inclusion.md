title: Inclusion@RSS
---

The RSS community is committed to increasing the participation of groups
traditionally underrepresented in robotics (including but not limited to: women,
LGBTQ+, underrepresented minorities, and people with disabilities), especially
people early in their studies and career. Such efforts are crucial for
increasing research capacity, creativity, and broadening the impact of robotics
research. To that end, Inclusion @ RSS will be an integral part of RSS that will
focus on programs that increase and sustain a broader participation in the
robotics research community.  Component programs will range from co-located
events to sponsored activities during the main conference.

The primary focus of the 2019 Inclusion@RSS will be to increase the number of
new conference participants. Comprehensive travel support will be awarded to
selected BSc, MSc, and first and second year PhD students.  Priority will be
given to students who have not previously attended RSS and/or are new to the
robotics research community. Applications can be submitted using <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/3r5w4tcqYRRCcRqN2">this form</a>.
