**How to get to RSS 2019 by plane**

We recommend to fly to [Frankfurt International Airport](http://www.frankfurt-airport.com/en.html). 
* From Frankfurt airport you best take the train to Freiburg which runs slightly more than two hours (every second ride requires to switch train in Mannheim).
* To get to the train station (Flughafen Fernbf meaning long distance trains) you need to walk for 10 minutes from Terminal 1. Including the waiting time to claim your luggage, we would calculate 50 minutes for making it to the platform from Terminal 1. From Terminal 2, you will have to take the sky train to Terminal 1 to get to the train station. This takes roughly an additional 15 minutes, so calculate for a total of 65 minutes from Terminal 2.
* Please visit the web page of [Deutsche Bahn](https://www.bahn.com/en/view/index.shtml) to find a suitable connection. In the web application, you need to enter: from: Frankfurt(M) Flughafen Fernbf / to: Freiburg(Breisgau) Hbf

Alternatively you could also fly to [Zurich](https://www.zurich-airport.com/), [Stuttgart Airport](http://www.stuttgart-airport.com/),
 or [Strasbourg Airport](http://www.strasbourg.aeroport.fr/en). Train connections from these airports are more complicated.

For inner european fligths you could also fly to [EUROAIRPORT Basel-Mulhouse-Freiburg](https://www.euroairport.com/en/).
