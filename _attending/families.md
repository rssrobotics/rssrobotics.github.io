### Freiburg B&auml;chle
Characteristic of the [historic city center of Freiburg](https://www.freiburg-geniessen.de/de/freiburg/altstadt.php) are the B&auml;chle, 
streamlets that meander through the whole city center amounting to a length of 15.5 kilometers. They used to supply the old city of Freiburg 
with fresh water and also carried away the sewage water, thus keeping the city clean. Today, the water of the Dreisam provides a pleasant climate.
On hot summer days people of all ages take refreshing footbaths in the streamlets.
