RSS Pioneers is a day-long workshop for senior graduate students and postdocs,
held in conjunction with the main RSS conference, that seeks to bring together a
cohort of the worldâ€™s top early career researchers in robotics. The second annual
RSS Pioneers will be held on Friday, June 21, 2019 at 
[Faculty of Engineering, University of Freiburg](https://goo.gl/maps/8KxyBKeqwQ62).

The goal of RSS Pioneers is to foster collaboration, networking, and
professional development among a new generation of robotics researchers. The
workshop will include a mix of research and career talks from senior scholars in
the field, research presentations from attendees, networking activities, and
mentoring of junior students, as part of the Inclusion@RSS initiative. To
facilitate attendance, the workshop will provide partial support for travel and
registration for RSS Pioneers and the main RSS 2019 conference.
